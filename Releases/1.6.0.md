## Version 1.6.0

### Analyzer

- Print warnings about non-monotonic timestamps, i.e. when some data that was measured after some other data was measured earlier according to the timestamp
- Add option (`-s`, `--sigma`) to show standard deviation of measurement data

### Plotter

- Print lines for data loss by default

  Before this update you needed to enable this feature with the option `-l`/`--loss`. Now you can use the option `-n`/`--no-loss` to disable the visualization of the data loss.

  The new behavior should make it easier to spot problematic measurement data with high data loss.

### Lint

- Check code with [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/)
